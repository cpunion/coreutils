coreutils
=========

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cpunion/coreutils.svg?branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.org/cpunion/coreutils)

This project is my learning project of Nim language, a Nim rewrite of the GNU coreutils.

Why?
----

I am a newbie for Nim language, sometimes I want to write production project using Nim, but I am not familiar with
Nim language, stdlib, other libraries and build tools. So I think I need to write a learning project.

Build Instructions
------------------

Simply to build:

```shell
nimble build
```

To modify and quick build:

```shell
# install npm, gulp
gulp
```
